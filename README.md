## Inspiration
On June 24, 2022, Roe v Wade Roe was overruled. Everyone knew this was coming, not only was the decision leaked but the refusal of women and people with a uterus to choose has had waves across the globe. In a time when data is sold, we wanted to create an app that would protect the right to choose and have a way to store menstrual data somewhere where there is no risk of it being sold. We wanted to create a user-friendly tracking app with features and help for people who want to prevent pregnancies and access abortion. We also have the aim of highlighting access to abortion for everyone especially people in places where it is very far away giving women+ what they deserve is that simple, Periodt. 

## What it does
It’s a menstrual app that will not take any information from its users at all about anything related to fertility. We found it odd that most menstrual apps have this huge focus on fertility indicators and are childish and hard to manage. Periodt tracks cycles with ease and links to help in getting abortions. It does it with the correct intention for our user, with no tracking and selling data and no hyperfocus on getting pregnant.  It is a period with a focus on the right to choose.

## How we built it
 The front end was built with Swift. This was used as an app to create great convince for our users and is easy to navigate and track menstrual cycles than a website. This is connected to a Google Firebase database. We choose this as Firebase can easily store user data. All of that information is connected with a node.js file that talks to a serverless cluster in Cockroach DB.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges when trying to narrow down what we wanted to impediment due to the time limit of this hackathon. We found it hard connecting with Cockroach DB but we found a way on the DB website that worked in the end. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Beyond being extremely proud of our amazing app that has a front and back end. We are so proud that we are bringing this issue, of period apps being extremely fertility-focused and not accommodating to people who don’t want to get pregnant coming up with this easy-to-use, beautiful app that can link with information about abortion access and health-focused care. 

## What we learned
We are so proud of learning how to use serverless Cockroach DB and connect with it using node.js. We also learnt more about UI/UX in making the app simple and straightforward to use. A 12-year-old experiencing their first period is just starting to learn about their body and a 22-year-old with endometriosis would have drastically different needs and that is something that other apps don’t acknowledge and we will. 

## What's next for Periodt
We plan on creating direct access to charities and support systems from our app and making the app fit for the user even more by having /discrete neutral skin. We understand accuracy is of the utmost importance, so we plan to Increase accuracy by investing in machine learning and plan on making the app age with the person.
